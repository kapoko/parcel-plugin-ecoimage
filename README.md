**Note**: Experimental, my first shot at creating a plugin for parcel, and under very relaxed development. 

# parcel-plugin-ecoimage ðŸŒ±

Plugin for Parcel for optimizing images to ridiculously small sizes for a small footprint, in a stylized way using heavy dithering and grayscale. 

## Prerequisites

Needs [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) installed on your machine. Install using brew:

```sh
brew install imagemagick
```

## Install

```
